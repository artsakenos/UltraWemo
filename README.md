# UltraWemo, pure Java Wemo Controller

In 2016 there are still not many devices with the basic characteristics a IoT object should have:

1. Easy to plug & play
2. Providing a handy interface
3. With a manageable and well documented set of APIs to control it by customized software

The only devices that nowadays better respect the first two paradigms belong to the [Belkin WeMo Home Automation](http://www.belkin.com/us/Products/home-automation/c/wemo-home-automation/) set.
As for the point 3 they just provide mobile API.

This project allows you to control your WeMo Devices with a pure Java library with no dependencies, creating a device wrapper by its ip.
So that you can use inside a blocked router network where Upnp discovery doesn't work.

See Wiki for further details.
